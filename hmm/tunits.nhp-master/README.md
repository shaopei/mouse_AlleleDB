Transcription Unit HMMs for Non-Human Primates

## Dependencies

The scripts require the following R packages:
- RQHMM
- bigWig
- tunits

which must be installed prior to running the scripts. These can be found (as git submodules) in the "rpkgs" folder.

The entire set can be obtained with the following command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/andrelmartins/tunits.nhp
```

The submodules will also require Roxygen or Roxygen2 R package to be installed during build time.
